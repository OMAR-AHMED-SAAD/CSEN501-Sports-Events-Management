# CSEN501 Sports Events Management

This project is a simple website for sports events management. We built a database system for managing sports events from stadiums, stadium managers, clubs, fans, tickets, admins, and club managers. The process started with planning, where we ended up with an end design. We then moved to the database implementation itself using Microsoft SQL Server engine. Finally, we experimented with using ASP.NET technology to produce an interactive system where you can log in, sign up from different types of users, and perform their functionalities from buying tickets, adding matches and stadiums, and blocking fans, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as Visual Studio).
3. Build the project and run it.

## Database Implementation

The database implementation of the sports events management system was done using Microsoft SQL Server engine. The database contains tables for managing stadiums, stadium managers, clubs, fans, tickets, admins, and club managers. Each table contains the necessary fields to store the relevant information. For example, the stadium table contains fields for the stadium name, location, capacity, and owner.

## ASP.NET Technology

The sports events management website was built using ASP.NET technology. This technology allowed us to create an interactive system that can handle user input and display data in real-time. The website includes different types of users, such as stadium managers, club managers, and fans. Each user has their own functionalities that they can perform, such as adding matches, blocking fans, and buying tickets.
